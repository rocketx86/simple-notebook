Here are the key features:

    * Clean and simple user interface
    * Full keyboard command control

Simple Notebook allows you to organize your notes into multiple notebooks, where each notebook can be used to organize multiple sections, and each section can be used to organize multiple entries. The open notebooks are displayed in the tab bar along the top of the work area. The active notebook's sections are displayed in the list on the upper left and the entries within the selected section are displayed in the list on the lower left. The text of the selected entry is displayed in the text pane on the right. Sections and entries can be copied and moved across open notebooks and sections.

Simple Notebook data files are portable because they are plain text files. Your notes can easily be opened by any other software product capable of processing text files. The notebooks and sections are stored as file folders, and entries are stored as text files. The order of sections and entries is maintained in a separate index file in each notebook folder. There is no information stored in the section folders or the text files themselves. All changes to your notebook are saved automatically to disk so there is little chance of your changes being lost.
