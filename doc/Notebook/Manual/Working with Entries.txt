Working with Entries

Entries are displayed in the lower left-hand listbox. Entries are the primary unit for organizing notes in the notebook. There is practically no limit to the number of entries that can be contained in a section. Entries are managed using the entry menu. The entry menu contains the commands available on entries. The entry menu can be opened from the menu bar or can be opened by right clicking in the entries area. Entries are stored as text files in the corresponding section's sub-folder. Changes to entries are saved automatically.

The entry menu has the following options:

Select Entry
The current entry can be changed by pressing the [UP] and [DOWN] keys or by clicking the left mouse button on the entry. When the selected entry changes, the text pane is updated with the associated text of the selected entry. To switch to edit mode, double click the entry, or press [ENTER]. When edit mode is enabled, the focus switches to the text pane and the cursor is positioned for editing. (See Working with Text)

Shift Entry
An entry can be shifted in the order by pressing [SHIFT+UP] or [SHIFT+DOWN], or by dragging the entry with the left mouse button while holding down the [SHIFT] key. This enables entries to be ordered in the section.

A new entry can be created by pressing the [SHIFT+F9] key, or selecting the create entry option from the entry menu. New entries are inserted above the selected entry.
