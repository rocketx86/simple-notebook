Working with Notebooks

Notebooks are displayed as tabs along the top of the work area. There is practically no limit to the number of notebooks that can be managed. Each notebook name is displayed on a separate tab. The active notebook can be changed by clicking on the notebook's tab. When the program is started, the previously open notebooks are opened. Each notebook must have a unique name among other notebooks. Notebooks are managed with the notebook menu. The notebook menu contains the commands available on notebooks.
